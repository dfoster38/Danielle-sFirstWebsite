		TOO RAD is a small unisex clothing brand created in 2019, offering comfortable, durable and affordable clothing and more. Every single item is 100% cotton, pre shrunk, and with ink made to last hundreds of washes without cracking or fading. Each design was hand drawn, scanned to create a digital copy, edited over Adobe Photoshop to meet the TOO RAD standards, then printed using silk screens. The designs are fairly simple, yet fun and meant to keep you lookin' rad. As the creator of TOO RAD, I persoanlly hope you enjoy what TOO RAD has to offer as much as I did creating it.
