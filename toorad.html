	<h1>Extension to TOO RAD Website</h1>
	<h3>TOO RAD has always been something I was passionate about, or at least art. A main struggle I had with myself was trying to figure out how can I make art, my passion apart of my carrer. Although TOO RAD is not something I lean on completely, it keeps me going in many ways. I wanted to find a way to hare my art without having to fully part ways ith it. Everytime I created something new, I was automatically attached to it. With TOO RAD, I can create perfect copies of what I make, and share it with the world. 
		My goal with TOO RAD was to create something that is comfortable, durable, affordable and meant to keep you lookin' rad. All of the things I was looking for in clothing, I feel I am making with this clothing. I will work hard a=on continuing what I'm doing, no mater the outcome. It will always be woth it to me.
